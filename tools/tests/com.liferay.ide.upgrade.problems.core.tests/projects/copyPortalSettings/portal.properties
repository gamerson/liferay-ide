    #
    # By default, in a remote staging environment, the live group is marked and
    # staging is prevented on the live group.
    #
    # To achieve a Content Development - UAT - Production environment, staging
    # must be enabled for the UAT live group involved. When staging is enabled
    # for this group, it becomes the live group with respect to the Content
    # Development server and a staging group with respect to the Production
    # server.
    #
    # Set this property to true to allow staging for a live group. If set to
    # true, staging can be turned on for a live group, so that it can
    # simultaneously act as both a live group and a staging group.

    # Set the file block sizes for remote staging. If a LAR file used for remote
    # staging exceeds this size, the file will be split into multiple files
    # prior to transmission and then reassembled on the remote server. The

    # Set this to true to allow Ehcache to use blocking caches. This improves
    # performance significantly by locking on keys instead of the entire cache.
    # The drawback is that threads can hang if the cache is not used properly.
    # Make sure that all queries that return a miss also immediately populate
    # the cache, or else other threads that are blocked on a query of that same
    # key will continue to hang. Reference Ehcache's BlockingCache for more
    # information. The blocking cache is no longer implemented by Ehcache's
    # BlockingCache, but by Liferay's BlockingPortalCache for better safety and
    # faster performance.
    #
    # Blocking cache together with transactional cache performs poorly, because
    # transactional cache affects the cache population visibility across
    # transactions. When transactional cache is on, blocking cache most likely
    # does nothing useful unless the transaction window time is short. When
    # transactional cache is off, it is better to turn on blocking cache for
    # better database access performance.
