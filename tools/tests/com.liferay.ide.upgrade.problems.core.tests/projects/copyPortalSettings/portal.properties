    #
    # By default, in a remote staging environment, the live group is marked and
    # staging is prevented on the live group.
    #
    # To achieve a Content Development - UAT - Production environment, staging
    # must be enabled for the UAT live group involved. When staging is enabled
    # for this group, it becomes the live group with respect to the Content
    # Development server and a staging group with respect to the Production
    # server.
    #
    # Set this property to true to allow staging for a live group. If set to
    # true, staging can be turned on for a live group, so that it can
    # simultaneously act as both a live group and a staging group.
